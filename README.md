# Algebraic effects and handlers

These are the notes and materials for the lectures on algebraic effects and
handlers at the [Oregon programming languages summer school 2018
(OPLSS)](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer18/index.php).

Each lecture contains a list of problems, which are ordered roughly in the order
of difficulty, either in terms of trickiness, the amount of work, or
prerequisites. I recommend that you discuss the problems in groups, and pick
whichever problems you find interesting.
