# Lecture 2: Designing a programming language

In the second lecture we shall focus on properly defining a core programming
language with algebraic effects and handlers, starting from 

* Syntax of core eff
* Operational semantics
* An effect system
* Progress & preservation
* Implementation

Reading material: [An effect system for algebraic effects and handlers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6316).
